    "# BYOC Data Ingestion Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through the process of ingesting data into a BYOC (Bring Your Own COG) collection in Sentinel Hub / Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using this notebook, you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sentinel Hub account with BYOC access\n",
    "2. Client ID and Client Secret for authentication\n",
    "3. Access to an S3 bucket containing your COG data in a supported system\n",
    "4. S3 credentials (username and password)\n",
    "5. Your data must be in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is organized into the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Required Libraries**: Setup and import all necessary dependencies\n",
    "2. **Set Up Credentials**: Configure access to Sentinel Hub and S3 storage\n",
    "3. **Configure Collection Parameters**: Set up collection information and data structure\n",
    "5. **Define Band Information**: Configure the bands for your data\n",
    "6. **Create Collection and Ingest Data**: Execute the ingestion process\n",
    "7. **Monitoring and Validation**: Verify the successful ingestion\n"

    "## 3. Configure Collection Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to configure the parameters for the BYOC collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Path Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The path configuration parameters are crucial for correctly extracting datetime information and identifying bands. When ingesting data into BYOC, the system uses these parameters to properly identify and organize your files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File Path Structure in BYOC\n",
    "\n",
    "In BYOC, files are referenced using a path with a `(BAND)` placeholder. For example, if your tile path is set to `folder/(BAND).tiff`, the system will replace `(BAND)` with the band source name to locate the actual files, like `folder/B01.tiff` or `folder/B02.tiff`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have files with the following structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "bucket-name/\n",
    "└── path_to_data/\n",
    "    ├── tile1_20220101/\n",
    "    │   ├── file_name_B01.tif\n",
    "    │   ├── file_name_B02.tif\n",
    "    │   └── file_name_B03.tif\n",
    "    └── tile2_20220102/\n",
    "        ├── file_name_B01.tif\n",
    "        ├── file_name_B02.tif\n",
    "        └── file_name_B03.tif\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For this structure, you would configure:\n",
    "\n",
    "**DATETIME_POSITION**:\n",
    "- `path`: 1 (the folder \"tile1_20220101\" is at position 1 in the path, as we don't count the bucket name)\n",
    "- `delimiter`: \"_\" (the delimiter in \"tile1_20220101\")\n",
    "- `folder`: 1 (the date part \"20220101\" is at position 1 after splitting)\n",
    "- `format`: \"%Y%m%d\" (the format of \"20220101\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**BAND_POSITION**:\n",
    "- `path`: -1 (the filename \"file_name_B01.tif\" is the last part of the path)\n",
    "- `delimiter`: \"_\" (the delimiter in \"file_name_B01.tif\")\n",
    "- `position`: 2 (the band part \"B01\" is at position 2 after splitting)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, all tiles in a collection must contain the same set of files with consistent naming. If a tile is missing one or more files, it will fail to ingest.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to adjust these parameters based on your specific file structure."

    "### Understanding BAND_INFORMATION\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BAND_INFORMATION` parameter is essential when working with bands that have special characters in their names, particularly hyphens (`-`). This is common in CLMS (Copernicus Land Monitoring Service) datasets where band names might contain hyphens or other special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a band name contains a hyphen, the Sentinel Hub API requires additional configuration beyond the basic path structure. This is where `BAND_INFORMATION` comes in:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "BAND_INFORMATION = [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"name\": \"B1\",         # The name you want to use for this band in your collection\n",
    "        \"source\": \"B1-NDVI\",  # The actual source name with hyphen as it appears in your files\n",
    "        \"bit_depth\": \"8\",     # The bit depth of this band\n",
    "        \"sample_format\": \"UINT\" # The sample format (UINT, INT, FLOAT)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling Hyphens**: When band names in your files contain hyphens (like `B1-NDVI`), you must explicitly declare them in `BAND_INFORMATION`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Band Renaming**: You can use this to rename complex band names to simpler ones:\n",
    "   - `\"name\"`: What you want the band to be called in your collection\n",
    "   - `\"source\"`: The actual name in the file path (including hyphens)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optional Usage**: If your band names don't contain hyphens or special characters, you can set `BAND_INFORMATION` to `None` or omit it entirely\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the ingestion process to correctly identify and rename the bands while handling the special characters in the file paths."
